### [Coding Bat](https://codingbat.com/java)

Every big programming problem has a lot of little programming problems in it. The little programming problems have elements we see again and again -- string and list manipulation, loops, a little logic. Working with students in office hours, I see what a big advantage it is for students who are practiced and quick with these little bits of code. Skill with the little code allows students to concentrate on the larger parts of the problem. Or put another other way, someone who struggles with the loops, logic, etc. does not have time for the big picture. CodingBat is all about building and practicing little code problems. The number of problems in each area is pretty large, so you can repeat and solidify your code skill in that area. Coding Practice
